This is a Chrome Extension that gives you shortcuts on [Messenger.com](https://messenger.com). First in series, second extension is [here](). Needed to have multiple because Chrome only allows 4 shortcuts for an extension. 

- Send Like: `Control + Up Key`
- Focus search bar: `Control + K`
- New message: `Control + N`
- Toggle Conversation Information: `Control + I`

More to come!
